Loss Events: This feature allows organizations to track, assess, and manage both internal and external events that could lead to operational losses. Multiple impact events and recoveries associated with operational losses can also be managed.\\n\\n2. Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSA): This feature enables identification, measurement, and mitigation of risks, as well as testing and documentation of internal controls.\\n\\n3. Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): These features allow tracking of performance metrics that may indicate the presence or state of a risk condition or trend.\\n\\n4. Scenario Analysis: This feature is used to identify and measure specific types of risks, particularly low-frequency, high-severity events.\\n\\n5. External Loss Events: This feature allows importing loss data from various sources such as IBM FIRST Risk Case Studies, ORX, and ORIC loss databases into OpenPages Operational Risk Management for scenario analysis, benchmarking, and report generation. Data can also be exported to analytical tools or capital allocation applications.\\n\\n6. Issue Management and Remediation (IMR): This feature includes issue creation, assignment, action creation and assignment, remediation performance, issue closure, and reporting.\\n\\n7. Reporting, monitoring, and analytics: This feature enables monitoring of performance and status of the Operational Risk Management program, as well as viewing the relationships between the Model Inventory and relevant aspects of policy and compliance obligations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the OpenPages Model Risk Governance module provides a platform for organizing, documenting, and maintaining an enterprise-wide inventory of models and their usages, documenting and tracking issues associated with models, recording Model Change management governance activities, scheduling, tracking, and managing Model Reviews and Validations, conducting periodic model attestations and model risk assessments, assigning appropriate roles and responsibilities for model ownership and model risk management, and monitoring performance and status of the Model Risk Management program. The module also integrates with IBM Watson OpenScale for monitoring and measuring outcomes from AI models across their lifecycle and performing ongoing validations of AI models. Lastly, the module includes an integration with the cyber risk quantification analysis platform RiskLens for risk assessment and loss exposure metric generation through Monte Carlo'}"

FastMap supports the import of Process and Risk objects but does not support the import of File and Signature objects or the system Comment field. It can also be used to import and export questionnaire template objects and their associated child objects, as well as the standard fields for questionnaire assessment instances.

              "1. Loss Events: This activity involves tracking, assessing, and managing both internal and external events that could result in operational losses. Multiple impact events and recoveries associated with operational losses can also be managed.\n",
              "\n",
              "2. Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSA): This activity involves identifying, measuring, and mitigating risks, testing and documenting internal controls.\n",
              "\n",
              "3. Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): These metrics can track performance metrics to potentially show the presence or state of a risk condition or trend.\n",
              "\n",
              "4. Scenario Analysis: This assessment technique is used to identify and measure specific kinds of risks, particularly low-frequency, high-severity events.\n",
              "\n",
              "5. External Loss Events: This feature provides the ability to import loss data from various sources like IBM FIRST Risk Case Studies, ORX, and ORIC loss databases into OpenPages Operational Risk Management for scenario analysis, benchmarking, and reports generation. Data can also be exported to analytic tools or capital allocation applications.\n",
              "\n",
              "6. Issue Management and Remediation (IMR): This activity includes issue creation and assignment, action creation and assignment, remediation performance, issue closedown, and reporting.\n",
              "\n",
              "7. Reporting, Monitoring, and Analytics: OpenPages Operational Risk Management offers reporting, monitoring, and analytics capabilities.\n",

              "Note: For more details on how to configure the RiskLens connector, refer to the IBM OpenPages with Watson Administrator's Guide.</td>\n",
